# CPU-Scheduling
This Java NetBeans project is a CPU scheduling system designed to demonstrate various CPU scheduling algorithms. CPU scheduling is a fundamental concept in operating systems, and this project provides a practical simulation of how different scheduling algorithms work.

**Features**
Multiple Scheduling Algorithms: The project includes implementations of several CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin.

**Visualization:**
The system visualizes the execution of processes, showing how they are scheduled and run on the CPU over time.

**User-Friendly Interface:**
The user interface is intuitive, making it easy to add processes, set their attributes (such as burst time and priority), and observe the scheduling results.

# Supported Scheduling Algorithms
**1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.
**2. Shortest Job Next (SJN)**
The process with the smallest burst time is executed first.
**3. Priority Scheduling**
Processes are scheduled based on their priority levels.
**4. Round Robin**
Each process is assigned a fixed time quantum, and they are executed in a circular order.
